# IncognitoThis

Instantly open any existing tab in a private window, and vice-versa!
Currently available as an extension for Google Chrome and Chromium browsers.

⚡️ [Click here to install!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/incognitothis/iimlkjcbebhfifhihbpddacmcpbjoejp)

## 🚀 Features

With just a click, open any existing tab in a new incognito window. If enabled in incognito, can open tabs in the normal window, exactly like a toggle!

### 🏃Roadmap

- [x] This currently opens a new window everytime though there is an existing incognito window. Need to check the feasibility of opening it in a tab if there is already an incognito window
- [x] As of now, it works one way, i.e, privatizes an existing tab. Would be interesting to open incognito tabs in a normal window
- [ ] Option to incognito these tabs in bulk, currently works for a single tab
- [ ] Add an option to incognito, in the drop-down upon right-clicking on the browser window
- [x] Choose a tab without any URL loaded instead of creating a new tab again

## 😇 Why did I build this?

Well, I tend to open shopping sites in incognito to see if there is any price difference.
Also, I read a lot of Medium articles in incognito. It doesn't check for subscription in incognito!

Since there is a lot of `Ctrl + c` and `Ctrl + v` involved in this repetitive task, I thought I could use some extension.
But the already existing ones are very old (no update since years) or doing something fishy.
So I thought, hey, I can build something simple like this and open-source it so that others could contribute from preventing it go stale and
the anyone can confidently install this extension.

## 🙌 Contributing

Feel free submit PRs! 😀

I'm a novice in developing extensions and I'm very open to learn good practices in building & architecting this project!
